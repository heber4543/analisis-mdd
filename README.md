# analisis-mdd
Set of codes that parse .txt data provided by SelNet to be able to visualize them. These codes were my first attempt in programming, I know that they have a bad syntax, logical errors and are stilted for not using functions to encompass certain procedures. However, they can be a starting point for you to begin your data analysis. I hope to correct them over time, if you have a question write me and we can adjust the code to your data. I can't guarantee it will work, but feel free to write me.
